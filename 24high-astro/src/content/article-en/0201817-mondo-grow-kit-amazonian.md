        "description": "The Mondo Grow Kit Amazonian is a fully prepared grow kit for growing Psilocybe cubensis Amazonian at home. This strain originates from the Amazon region and is often associated with a powerful, visual and dreamlike psychedelic experience. Amazonian is also known for its relatively rapid and straightforward growth, making the grow kit appealing to both novice and experienced growers.\nThe Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit is a 1200 cc grow kit containing active Psilocybe cubensis Amazonian mycelium.\nAt 24High, we work with grow kits and other products in our psychedelic range on a daily basis. That&rsquo;s why we believe it&rsquo;s important not only to tell you what you&rsquo;re buying, but also to clearly explain how the growing process works, what you need to bear in mind whilst caring for the mushrooms, and how to handle the end product responsibly.\nWhat is the Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit?\nThe Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit contains a prepared substrate with active mycelium of the Amazonian strain. The grow tray has a capacity of 1200 cc and comes with a grow bag and a paperclip. This means you have the essential components for setting up the grow kit straight to hand.\nCurious to know how the mycelium develops further after set-up? In our guide to the home-growing process, you&rsquo;ll discover the different growth stages a magic mushroom grow kit goes through.\nAmazonian is a Psilocybe cubensis variety associated with the Amazon region in South America. The mushrooms can develop sturdy, fleshy stems and golden-brown to orange caps. Under favourable conditions, this variety is known for its relatively rapid growth.\nWhy choose the Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit?\nAmazonian is often chosen for its combination of an accessible cultivation process, rapid development and a potent psychedelic effect. This strain can produce large and sturdy fruiting bodies, making it an interesting choice for growers seeking a productive cubensis strain.\nThe cultivation process is also relatively straightforward. Provided that temperature, humidity, light and fresh air are properly monitored, multiple flushes are possible.\nIs the Amazonian Grow Kit suitable for beginners?\nThe Grow Kit is considered relatively straightforward in terms of cultivation and may therefore be suitable for novice mushroom growers. The prepared substrate takes several steps out of the growing process.\nHowever, the resulting Amazonian magic mushrooms can provide a powerful psychedelic experience. Anyone with little experience of psilocybin would therefore be well advised to exercise caution and bear in mind the intensity of this strain.\nWhat effects can you expect from Amazonian magic mushrooms?\nAmazonian is a potent Psilocybe cubensis strain often associated with vivid visuals, a dreamlike atmosphere and an initially energetic or euphoric effect.\n\nDistinct visual effects\nMore intense colours and patterns\nA dreamlike psychedelic experience\nEuphoric or uplifted feelings\nAltered perception of time and space\nCreative thought patterns\nMore intense sensory perception\n\nThe effects actually experienced vary from person to person. Dosage, mood, environment, previous experience and personal sensitivity all influence the course and intensity of a trip.\nAmazonian is known for producing a powerful, visual and often dreamlike psychedelic experience.\nHow do you use Amazonian magic mushrooms?\nAfter harvesting, Amazonian magic mushrooms can be used fresh or dried first. Fresh mushrooms contain much more moisture and therefore weigh considerably more than dried ones. Always bear this in mind when weighing out a quantity.\nGeneral dosage guideline\n\nMild experience: approximately 0.8 to 1 gram dried or 8 to 10 grams fresh.\nMild psychedelic experience: approximately 1 to 1.5 grams dried or 10 to 15 grams fresh.\nStronger psychedelic experience: approximately 1.5 to 3 grams dried or 15 to 30 grams fresh.\nIntense experience: approximately 3 to 4 grams dried or 30 to 40 grams fresh.\nVery intense experience: approximately 4 to 5 grams dried or 40 to 50 grams fresh.\n\nSensitivity to psilocybin varies greatly from person to person. You should therefore use an accurate set of scales, start cautiously and allow plenty of time for the effects to develop.\nHow do you prepare for an Amazonian psilocybin trip?\nA familiar environment can make a big difference during a powerful Amazonian experience. Make sure you have peace and quiet, plenty of time and people you feel comfortable with beforehand. If you have little experience, a sober trip sitter can offer extra support.\n\nChoose a quiet and familiar setting.\nMake sure you have no further commitments.\nDo not consume alcohol or other drugs.\nIdeally, trip with people you know well.\nHave drinks, music and other essentials ready in advance.\nConsider having a sober trip sitter for a more intense experience.\n\nA good experience begins even before consumption. In our guide to setting, intention and preparation, you can read about how to consciously focus on the circumstances surrounding a psychedelic experience.\nGrowing information: Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit\n\nSize: 1200 cc\nVariety: Psilocybe cubensis Amazonian\nGrowing difficulty: easy\nGrowth: relatively fast\nFruit bodies: firm, fleshy mushrooms\nCap: golden brown to orange\nPossible flushes: up to around 5 under favourable conditions\n\nHow does the Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit work?\nWhen setting up, always follow the instructions supplied with the grow kit. Work in a clean environment and place the grow kit in a spot away from direct sunlight or direct heat, such as from a radiator. A temperature of around 24 &deg;C is recommended as a practical starting point in the cultivation guide provided.\nDownload the instructions for setting up the Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit here.\nLight, moisture and fresh air each play their own role during the growing process. Do not place the grow tray in direct sunlight and do not spray water directly onto the substrate. If moistening is required, aim the spray at the inside of the grow bag and then reseal it with the paperclip.\nA grow kit is highly sensitive to its environment. You should therefore also read our guide on common mistakes and lessons learnt from home cultivation to better recognise common problems during the growing process.\nEven small mistakes can affect the development of your grow kit. So read on  to find outhow  to recognise, rectify and prevent common mistakes with magic mushroom grow kits.\nHow long does it take before you can harvest Amazonian?\nAmazonian is known as a relatively fast-growing cubensis strain. According to the product information provided, the first magic mushrooms can appear within about two weeks under favourable conditions. The actual growth time may vary from one grow kit to another.\nTemperature, humidity, light and the condition of the mycelium all influence the rate of growth. Is the development taking a little longer? In our guide to support and guidance for home cultivation, you&rsquo;ll find practical advice on how to assess the progress of your grow kit.\nWhen should you harvest Amazonian magic mushrooms?\nThe right time to harvest is when the membrane between the cap and the stem starts to come loose. Check the mushrooms regularly once they start to develop, as the caps can open relatively quickly after that.\nGently grasp a mushroom by the stem and twist it loose carefully. Do not pull hard on the mushroom, as this could damage the surrounding mycelium and potentially affect a subsequent flush.\nHow do you get multiple flushes from the Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit?\nUnder the right conditions, the Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit can produce multiple harvests. According to the product information provided, this strain can produce up to around five flushes, with the first flushes generally being the largest.\nAfter harvesting, the grow kit can be prepared for use again. Fill the grow tray with fresh water as per the Mondo instructions, place the lid on top and leave the sealed grow tray in the fridge for around 12 hours. The next growth cycle can then be started.\nFor multiple flushes, careful harvesting is important. Minimise damage to the substrate and mycelium as much as possible and follow Mondo&rsquo;s instructions again for each new cycle.\nContents of the Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit\n\n1x Mondo Amazonian grow box (1200 cc)\nSubstrate with active mycelium\n1x grow bag\n1x paperclip\nGrowing instructions\n\nTo look after the grow kit, you will also need a clean working environment, water and a suitable method for misting.\nWhat is the yield of the Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit?\nAccording to the product information provided, the total yield under good conditions can be approximately 300 to 600 grams of fresh magic mushrooms. The actual yield varies per grow and is influenced by the conditions, care and the number of successful flushes.\n\n\nSize\n\n1200 cc\n\n\n\nYield*\n\nApproximately 300 to 600 grams of fresh magic mushrooms\n\n\n\n*The final yield depends on growing conditions, care and the number of successful flushes.\nHow do you store the Mondo Amazonian Growkit?\nA magic mushroom grow kit is a living, fresh product. We therefore recommend setting up the Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit as soon as possible after receipt. This provides the active mycelium with the right conditions to begin the next growth phase.\nCan&rsquo;t get started straight away? Then follow the storage instructions on the packaging and don&rsquo;t delay setting it up any longer than necessary.\nWho is the Mondo Amazonian Growkit suitable for?\nThe Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit is particularly suitable for people looking for a relatively fast-growing and easy-to-care-for Psilocybe cubensis grow kit. This makes the grow kit an attractive option for both novice and experienced mushroom growers.\nDo bear in mind, however, the potent nature of the resulting Amazonian magic mushrooms. Experience with growing and experience with psychedelics are two different things.\nWhat alternatives are there?\nNot sure if Amazonian is right for you? The 24High range includes several otherPsilocybe cubensis grow kits, each with its own unique growing and experiential characteristics.\n\nMexicana &ndash;  a medium-strength strain often associated with philosophical and creative experiences.\nTreasure Coast &ndash;  a relatively accessible cubensis strain known for its rapid growth and balanced psychedelic profile.\n\nWhich grow kit suits you best depends on your growing experience, your experience with psychedelics and the nature of the strain you&rsquo;re looking for.\nSafety and responsible use\nOnly use magic mushrooms if you are an adult and well-informed. Do not combine psychedelics with alcohol or other recreational drugs, and do not operate vehicles or machinery whilst the effects are still present.\nPsychedelics are not recommended for people with a personal or family history of psychosis, schizophrenia or other serious psychiatric conditions. Are you taking medication, or are you pregnant or breastfeeding?

<p>The <strong>Mondo </strong><strong>Grow Kit </strong><strong>Amazonian</strong> is a fully prepared grow kit for growing <em>Psilocybe cubensis</em> Amazonian at home. This strain originates from the Amazon region and is often associated with a powerful, visual and dreamlike psychedelic experience. Amazonian is also known for its relatively rapid and straightforward growth, making the grow kit appealing to both novice and experienced growers.</p>
<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9; border-left: 5px solid #55b308; padding: 15px 20px; margin: 30px 0; font-style: italic; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;"><strong>The Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit is a 1200 cc grow kit containing active <em>Psilocybe cubensis</em> Amazonian mycelium.</strong></blockquote>
<p>At 24High, we work with grow kits and other products in our psychedelic range on a daily basis. That’s why we believe it’s important not only to tell you what you’re buying, but also to clearly explain how the growing process works, what you need to bear in mind whilst caring for the mushrooms, and how to handle the end product responsibly.</p>
<h2>What is the Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit?</h2>
<p>The Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit contains a prepared substrate with active mycelium of the Amazonian strain. The grow tray has a capacity of 1200 cc and comes with a grow bag and a paperclip. This means you have the essential components for setting up the grow kit straight to hand.</p>
<p>Curious to know how the mycelium develops further after set-up? In our guide to <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #1649f5;"><a href="../guide/home-growing-and-deeper-exploration/the-growing-process.html" style="color: #1649f5; text-decoration: underline;">the home-growing process</a></span>, you’ll discover the different growth stages a magic mushroom grow kit goes through.</p>
<p>Amazonian is a <em>Psilocybe cubensis variety</em> associated with the Amazon region in South America. The mushrooms can develop sturdy, fleshy stems and golden-brown to orange caps. Under favourable conditions, this variety is known for its relatively rapid growth.</p>
<h2>Why choose the Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit?</h2>
<p>Amazonian is often chosen for its combination of an accessible cultivation process, rapid development and a potent psychedelic effect. This strain can produce large and sturdy fruiting bodies, making it an interesting choice for growers seeking a productive cubensis strain.</p>
<p>The cultivation process is also relatively straightforward. Provided that temperature, humidity, light and fresh air are properly monitored, multiple flushes are possible.</p>
<h2>Is the Amazonian Grow Kit suitable for beginners?</h2>
<p>The Grow Kit is considered relatively straightforward in terms of cultivation and may therefore be suitable for novice mushroom growers. The prepared substrate takes several steps out of the growing process.</p>
<p>However, the resulting Amazonian magic mushrooms can provide a powerful psychedelic experience. Anyone with little experience of psilocybin would therefore be well advised to exercise caution and bear in mind the intensity of this strain.</p>
<h2>What effects can you expect from Amazonian magic mushrooms?</h2>
<p>Amazonian is a potent <em>Psilocybe cubensis strain</em> often associated with vivid visuals, a dreamlike atmosphere and an initially energetic or euphoric effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Distinct visual effects</li>
<li>More intense colours and patterns</li>
<li>A dreamlike psychedelic experience</li>
<li>Euphoric or uplifted feelings</li>
<li>Altered perception of time and space</li>
<li>Creative thought patterns</li>
<li>More intense sensory perception</li>
</ul>
<p>The effects actually experienced vary from person to person. Dosage, mood, environment, previous experience and personal sensitivity all influence the course and intensity of a trip.</p>
<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9; border-left: 5px solid #55b308; padding: 15px 20px; margin: 30px 0; font-style: italic; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;"><strong>Amazonian is known for producing a powerful, visual and often dreamlike psychedelic experience.</strong></blockquote>
<h2>How do you use Amazonian magic mushrooms?</h2>
<p>After harvesting, Amazonian magic mushrooms can be used fresh or dried first. Fresh mushrooms contain much more moisture and therefore weigh considerably more than dried ones. Always bear this in mind when weighing out a quantity.</p>
<h3>General dosage guideline</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mild experience: approximately 0.8 to 1 gram dried or 8 to 10 grams fresh.</li>
<li>Mild psychedelic experience: approximately 1 to 1.5 grams dried or 10 to 15 grams fresh.</li>
<li>Stronger psychedelic experience: approximately 1.5 to 3 grams dried or 15 to 30 grams fresh.</li>
<li>Intense experience: approximately 3 to 4 grams dried or 30 to 40 grams fresh.</li>
<li>Very intense experience: approximately 4 to 5 grams dried or 40 to 50 grams fresh.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sensitivity to psilocybin varies greatly from person to person. You should therefore use an accurate set of scales, start cautiously and allow plenty of time for the effects to develop.</p>
<h2>How do you prepare for an Amazonian psilocybin trip?</h2>
<p>A familiar environment can make a big difference during a powerful Amazonian experience. Make sure you have peace and quiet, plenty of time and people you feel comfortable with beforehand. If you have little experience, a sober trip sitter can offer extra support.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a quiet and familiar setting.</li>
<li>Make sure you have no further commitments.</li>
<li>Do not consume alcohol or other drugs.</li>
<li>Ideally, trip with people you know well.</li>
<li>Have drinks, music and other essentials ready in advance.</li>
<li>Consider having a sober trip sitter for a more intense experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>A good experience begins even before consumption. In our guide to <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #1649f5;"><a href="../guide/natural-psychedelics-experience-types/setting-intention-preparation.html" style="color: #1649f5; text-decoration: underline;">setting, intention and preparation</a></span>, you can read about how to consciously focus on the circumstances surrounding a psychedelic experience.</p>

</ul>
<h2>How does the Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit work?</h2>
<p>When setting up, always follow the instructions supplied with the grow kit. Work in a clean environment and place the grow kit in a spot away from direct sunlight or direct heat, such as from a radiator. A temperature of around 24 °C is recommended as a practical starting point in the cultivation guide provided.</p>
<p><span style="color: #1649f5;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="../files/index.html@id=3063.pdf&amp;file=mondo-magic-mushroom-growkit-manual+(2).pdf" style="color: #1649f5; text-decoration: underline;">Download the instructions for setting up the Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit here.</a></span></strong></span></p>
<p>Light, moisture and fresh air each play their own role during the growing process. Do not place the grow tray in direct sunlight and do not spray water directly onto the substrate. If moistening is required, aim the spray at the inside of the grow bag and then reseal it with the paperclip.</p>
<p>A grow kit is highly sensitive to its environment. You should therefore also read our guide on <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #1649f5;"><a href="../guide/home-growing-and-deeper-exploration/mistakes-and-learning-experiences.html" style="color: #1649f5; text-decoration: underline;">common mistakes and lessons learnt from home cultivation</a></span> to better recognise common problems during the growing process.</p>
<p><span>Even small mistakes can affect the development of your grow kit. So read on </span><span> to find out</span><span>how </span><span> to recognise, rectify and prevent </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #1649f5;"><a href="../blog/483/recognise-fix-and-avoid-common-mistakes-with-mushroom-grow-kits.html" style="color: #1649f5; text-decoration: underline;">common mistakes with magic mushroom grow kits</a></span><span>.</span></p>
<h2>How long does it take before you can harvest Amazonian?</h2>
<p>Amazonian is known as a relatively fast-growing cubensis strain. According to the product information provided, the first magic mushrooms can appear within about two weeks under favourable conditions. The actual growth time may vary from one grow kit to another.</p>
<p>Temperature, humidity, light and the condition of the mycelium all influence the rate of growth. Is the development taking a little longer? In our guide to <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #1649f5;"><a href="../guide/self-growing-and-deeper-understanding/support-and-guidance.html" style="color: #1649f5; text-decoration: underline;">support and guidance for home cultivation</a></span>, you’ll find practical advice on how to assess the progress of your grow kit.</p>
<h2>When should you harvest Amazonian magic mushrooms?</h2>
<p>The right time to harvest is when the membrane between the cap and the stem starts to come loose. Check the mushrooms regularly once they start to develop, as the caps can open relatively quickly after that.</p>
<p>Gently grasp a mushroom by the stem and twist it loose carefully. Do not pull hard on the mushroom, as this could damage the surrounding mycelium and potentially affect a subsequent flush.</p>
<h2>How do you get multiple flushes from the Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit?</h2>
<p>Under the right conditions, the Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit can produce multiple harvests. According to the product information provided, this strain can produce up to around five flushes, with the first flushes generally being the largest.</p>
<p>After harvesting, the grow kit can be prepared for use again. Fill the grow tray with fresh water as per the Mondo instructions, place the lid on top and leave the sealed grow tray in the fridge for around 12 hours. The next growth cycle can then be started.</p>
<p>For multiple flushes, careful harvesting is important. Minimise damage to the substrate and mycelium as much as possible and follow Mondo’s instructions again for each new cycle.</p>

<h2>How do you store the Mondo Amazonian Growkit?</h2>
<p>A magic mushroom grow kit is a living, fresh product. We therefore recommend setting up the Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit as soon as possible after receipt. This provides the active mycelium with the right conditions to begin the next growth phase.</p>
<p>Can’t get started straight away? Then follow the storage instructions on the packaging and don’t delay setting it up any longer than necessary.</p>
<h2>Who is the Mondo Amazonian Growkit suitable for?</h2>
<p>The Mondo Amazonian Grow Kit is particularly suitable for people looking for a relatively fast-growing and easy-to-care-for <em>Psilocybe cubensis grow kit</em>. This makes the grow kit an attractive option for both novice and experienced mushroom growers.</p>
<p>Do bear in mind, however, the potent nature of the resulting Amazonian magic mushrooms. Experience with growing and experience with psychedelics are two different things.</p>
<h2>What alternatives are there?</h2>
<p>Not sure if Amazonian is right for you? The 24High range includes several other<em>Psilocybe cubensis grow kits</em>, each with its own unique growing and experiential characteristics.</p>

</ul>
<p>Which grow kit suits you best depends on your growing experience, your experience with psychedelics and the nature of the strain you’re looking for.</p>
<h2>Safety and responsible use</h2>
<p>Only use magic mushrooms if you are an adult and well-informed. Do not combine psychedelics with alcohol or other recreational drugs, and do not operate vehicles or machinery whilst the effects are still present.</p>
<p>Psychedelics are not recommended for people with a personal or family history of psychosis, schizophrenia or other serious psychiatric conditions. Are you taking medication, or are you pregnant or breastfeeding? If so, please discuss use with a doctor beforehand.</p>
